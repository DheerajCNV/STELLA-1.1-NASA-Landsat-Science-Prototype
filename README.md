# STELLA-1.1-NASA-Landsat-Science-Prototype

I developed two prototypes of [STELLA]([url](https://github.com/DheerajCNV/STELLA-Portable-Remote-Sensing-for-Water-Quality-Monitoring/tree/main/Images)) (Science and Technology Education for Land/Life Assessment), a portable handheld remote sensing device, as part of the NASA Landsat Initiative. These prototypes incorporate cost-effective multi-spectral sensors housed in a 3D-printed design, enabling real-time environmental monitoring and water quality assessment.

<h2>Purpose & Applications</h2>
STELLA is an open-source, low-cost spectrometer designed to enhance remote sensing education and environmental monitoring. It integrates VIS-NIR spectroscopy and chemical analysis capabilities to measure key water parameters, including:
Algal growth
Turbidity
Nutrient levels (Nitrogen & Phosphorus)
Microplastics & microbial contaminants

<h2>Experimental Research & Citizen Science</h2>
STELLA aligns field-collected spectral data with Earth Observation (EO) satellite data for water quality assessment.
Used in community science projects, environmental education, and EO validation, bridging the gap between satellite observations and ground-truth data.
Enables watershed modeling and scientific research by integrating EO data with citizen-collected datasets.
This project advances scientific literacy, fosters data-driven environmental stewardship, and provides a scalable, accessible tool for researchers, educators, and citizen scientists.
